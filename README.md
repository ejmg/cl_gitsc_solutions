# Solutions for Common Lisp: a Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by Touretzky

## Why

I wanted to learn Lisp, that's why.

### Why Lisp

Because I could, that's why.

## Organization

I only solved the exercises that interested me (the moderately harder problems in the book) so I only started around chapter 5.

For each chapter, I grouped solutions by subsection and wrote up an individual file for each problem. As an example, a solution for exercise 2.2 found in
subsection 2.4 would be in the subfolder `2_4` as the file `2_2.lisp`.

Finally, at the end of each chapter starting around 5 there are large-ish `Keyboard Exercise`s. These are saved under the unique subfolder `keyboard_exercise` for
each chapter I did the keyboard exercise.

I won't do every problem in this book but for the ones I did, I did so without any assistance minus other online notes outside of this book. When my solutions were
particularly hacky, I'll probably post the author's solution within the same file for comparison. Some of them make you especially wince (`looks at the final subproblem solution in chapter 8's keyboard exercise`).

## Review of the book

I'm almost done with the book, but I can already say this was an absolute pleasure to read. I managed to do it in about a month because Touretzky clearly loves teaching, has a strong grasp
on his subject. If you have the spare time and like to explore fun/powerful/unique programming languages then you will enjoy this book.
